Description: Collection of cryptographic and security-related libraries
 The aim of the Cryb.to project is to provide a collection of correct,
 well-written, well-tested and well-documented implementations of both
 low-level cryptographic primitives and higher-level security-related
 interfaces under a permissive license.
 .
 The Cryb libraries are the first and primary product of the Cryb.to
 project.  They include low-level cryptographic primitives and support
 code such as safe string handling and containers.
