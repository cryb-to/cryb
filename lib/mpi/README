Portable multiple-precision integer library.

The interface is loosely based on XySSL's MPI library.  The
implementation was written from scratch based on the algorithms
described in Menezes, van Oorschot and Vanstone: _Handbook of Applied
Cryptography_, CRC Press, 1996.  The full text of the HAC is available
for personal use at http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/.

This implementation sacrifices performance for portability and
readability, but attempts have been made to structure it in such a way
that critical portions can easily be replaced with machine-dependent
optimized versions.

The code assumes a 64-bit machine or a 32-bit machine where 64-bit
integer arithmetic is supported but not necessarily efficient; 64-bit
operations are used only to simplify overflow handling.
