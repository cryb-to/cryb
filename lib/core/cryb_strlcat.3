.Sh NAME
.Nm cryb_strlcat
.Nd safely append a string to a buffer
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcryb
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stddef.h
.In cryb/strlcat.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn cryb_strlcat "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cryb_strlcat
function appends the NUL-terminated string pointed to by
.Va src
to the NUL-terminated string stored in the buffer pointed to by
.Va dst .
The
.Va size
argument specifies the total size of the buffer including the space
occupied by the existing string and space for the terminating NUL
character.
If the sum of the lengths of both strings exceeds the available space,
the result is truncated.
In either case, the destination buffer is properly NUL-terminated.
.Pp
If the buffer pointed to by
.Va dst
does not contain a NUL character within the first
.Va size
bytes,
.Nm
behaves as if the length of
.Va dst
is
.Va size .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cryb_strlcat
function returns the sum of the lengths of the original strings.
If this number is equal to or greater than the value of
.Va size ,
the string was too long to fit in the buffer.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
If the
.Dv HAVE_STRLCAT
preprocessor macro is defined to 0 or undefined, the
.In cryb/strlcat.h
header provides a
.Fn strlcat
macro as an alias to
.Fn cryb_strlcat .
