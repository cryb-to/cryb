.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cryb_memcpy_s
.Nd safely copy one buffer to another
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcryb-core
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In cryb/memcpy_s.h
.Ft void *
.Fn cryb_memcpy_s "void *d" "size_t dsz" "const void *s" "size_t n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cryb_memcpy_s
function copies the first
.Va n
bytes of the buffer pointed to by
.Va s
into the buffer pointed to by
.Va d ,
of size
.Va dsz .
If
.Va s
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Va n
is greater than
.Va dsz
or
.Dv SIZE_MAX
or the source and destination overlap, the buffer pointed to by
.Va d
is filled with zeroes and an error is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cryb_memcpy_s
function returns zero if successful and a non-zero error code if an
error occurred.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Va d
argument was
.Dv NULL
or the source and destination ranges were found to overlap.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
Either or both of the
.Va dsz
and
.Va n
arguments were greater than
.Dv SIZE_MAX .
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
The
.Va n
argument was greater than the
.Va dsz
argument.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
If the
.Dv HAVE_MEMCPY_S
preprocessor macro is defined to 0 or undefined, the
.In cryb/memcpy_s.h
header provides a
.Fn memcpy_s
macro as an alias to
.Fn cryb_memcpy_s .
.Pp
The argument and return types for
.Nm
differ from those of its C11 equivalent, as it is expected to be used
in environments in which
.Vt rsize_t
and
.Dv RSIZE_MAX
are not defined.
