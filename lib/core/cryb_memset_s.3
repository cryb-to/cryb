.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cryb_memset_s
.Nd safely fill a buffer
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcryb-core
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In cryb/memset_s.h
.Ft void *
.Fn cryb_memset_s "void *d" "size_t dsz" "int ch" "size_t n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cryb_memset_s
function overwrites the first
.Va n
bytes of the buffer pointed to by
.Va d ,
of size
.Va dsz ,
with copies of the least-significant byte of
.Va ch .
If
.Va n
is greater than
.Va dsz ,
only
.Va dsz
bytes are overwritten, and an error is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns zero if successful and a non-zero error code if an
error occurred.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Va d
argument was
.Dv NULL .
.It Bq Er ERANGE
Either or both of the
.Va dsz
and
.Va n
arguments were greater than
.Dv SIZE_MAX .
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
The
.Va n
argument was greater than the
.Va dsz
argument.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
If the
.Dv HAVE_MEMSET_S
preprocessor macro is defined to 0 or undefined, the
.In cryb/memset_s.h
header provides a
.Fn memset_s
macro as an alias to
.Fn cryb_memset_s .
.Pp
The argument and return types for
.Nm
differ from those of its C11 equivalent, as it is expected to be used
in environments in which
.Vt rsize_t
and
.Dv RSIZE_MAX
are not defined.
