.Sh NAME
.Nm cryb_hash ,
.Nm cryb_strhash
.Nd hash functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcryb-hash
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In cryb/hash.h
.Ft uint8_t
.Fn cryb_hash "const void *data" "size_t len"
.Ft uint8_t
.Fn cryb_strhash "const char *str"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cryb_hash
function returns an 8-bit hash of the
.Va len
first bytes of the object pointed to by
.Va data .
.Pp
The
.Fn cryb_strhash
function returns an 8-bit hash of the NUL-terminated string pointed to
by
.Va str ,
not including the terminating NUL.
It is equivalent to calling
.Li cryb_hash(str, strlen(str)) .
