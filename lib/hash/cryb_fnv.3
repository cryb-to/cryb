.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cryb_fnv0_32_hash ,
.Fn cryb_fnv1_32_hash ,
and
.Fn cryb_fnv1a_32_hash ,
functions return a 32-bit hash of the
.Va len
first bytes of the object pointed to by
.Va data
using the Fowler-Noll-Vo (FNV) 0, 1, and 1a algorithms respectively.
.Pp
The
.Fn cryb_fnv0_64_hash ,
.Fn cryb_fnv1_64_hash ,
and
.Fn cryb_fnv1a_64_hash ,
functions return a 64-bit hash of the
.Va len
first bytes of the object pointed to by
.Va data
using the FNV 0, 1, and 1a algorithms respectively.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.In cryb/hash.h
header provides macros which allows these functions to be referred to
without their
.Dq Li cryb_
prefix.
