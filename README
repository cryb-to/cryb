The aim of the Cryb.to project is to provide a collcetion of correct,
well-written, well-tested and well-documented implementations of both
low-level cryptographic primitives and higher-level security-related
interfaces under a permissive license.

The Cryb libraries are the first and primary product of the Cryb.to
project.  They include low-level cryptographic primitives and support
code such as safe string handling and containers.
